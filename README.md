# Virtual-Chemistry-lab
Developed an interactive Virtual Chemistry Lab web application using React.js and Next.js. The platform allows users to select and combine different chemicals, simulating real-life chemical reactions. Key features include:

Dynamic Reaction Database: Displays chemical equations and descriptions when specific combinations are selected.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for selecting and deselecting flasks and tracking selected chemicals.
Responsive Design: Seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
This project demonstrates my expertise in front-end development, state management, and UI/UX design while enhancing the learning experience for students and enthusiasts in the field of chemistry.
